    <img src="images/pikachus.jpg" alt="Pikachus marchinng">

    <p>Pikachu are a bright, yellow Pokemon that resemble a mouse. They are quite energetic and exciting, often times electrifying! Speaking of which, they are electric type Pokemon! Pikachu are capable of producing electricity from glands in their cheeks, which can be quite shocking to the touch.</p>

    <p>As an electric type Pokemon, Pikachu are weak against ground types. In fact, ground types are actually immune to electricity! This doesn’t mean Pikachu can’t attack them though, since Pikachu can learn moves of other types. One of these moves is the infamous Quick Attack, a normal type attack. When using this attack, Pikachu attack first in the turn order, and strike quickly.</p>

    <p>Types that Pikachu are good against include:</p>

    <ul>
      <li>Flying</li>
      <li>Water</li>
    </ul>

    <p>Through TM's(or technical machines), Pikachu can also be effective against:</p>

    <ul>
        <li>Grass and Fairy, with TM06 Toxic</li>
        <li>Normal, Ice, Rock, Dark, and Steel with TM31 Brick Break</li>
        <li>Ground, with TM86 Grass Knot</li>
      </ul>
